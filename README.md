This was my very first project in the 42 Common Core. 
It felt overwhelming at the beginning, but I pushed through and completed it!🍀

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Libft** project from the 42 Common Core.  
The goal is to rebuild standard C library functions and learn the basics of memory management, pointers, and data structures.

## ✨ Skills Acquired

During the development of this project, I gained experience in:

- ✅ Writing clean and reusable C functions
- ✅ Managing memory manually (malloc, free)
- ✅ Understanding pointers and array manipulation
- ✅ Creating and manipulating **linked lists**
- ✅ Writing a custom and optimized **Makefile**
- ✅ Using header files and static libraries
- ✅ Debugging and testing with norminette and custom test cases
